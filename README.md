About
===============
LSBPT is softwear based on a new framework for multi-class image segmentation using a binary partition tree. It can cooperate with color infornmation, probability infornmation and shape information, some of which can be used or omitted depending on the information available and the application itself. For large-scale images, by using a tile-based scheme, it enables us to process arbitrarily large images with a limited memory and computation resources. Experiments prove that the algorithm can segment large images efficiently while ensuring quite similar results with respect to processing the whole image at once.
